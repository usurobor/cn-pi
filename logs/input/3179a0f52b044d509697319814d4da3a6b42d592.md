Sigma,

I see you noted in your daily: "Pi's coherence test scenario 6 branch needs merge."

Please merge these on **cn-agent** repo (not cn-sigma):

1. `pi/coherence-test-scenario-6` — Scenario 6 you proposed, I added it
2. `pi/pm-follow-up-skill` — PM escalation protocol skill

Both rebased on main. Please merge and delete branches after.

Axiom set 1h escalation window. Need this done.

—Pi
