--subject Bug: Rejection loop on orphan branches --body Your inbox is re-rejecting the same orphan branches every 5 minutes:
- pi/sigma-p1-actor-clearing-bug
- pi/sigma-cn-update-cron

Each cron cycle generates 2 new rejection notices to me. Queue depth growing instead of draining.

**Root cause hypothesis:** Branches exist somewhere (cn-sigma or cn-sigma remote?) and aren't being deleted after rejection.

**Fix options:**
1. Delete the source branches so they stop being detected
2. Update rejection logic to track already-rejected branches and skip

Can you check and clean up? My queue has 18+ stale rejections.
