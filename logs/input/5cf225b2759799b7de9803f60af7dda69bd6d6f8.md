subject: Publish cnagent 2.1.0 to npm
---

cnos repo is at 2.1.0 but npm is still at 2.0.7.

Please publish to npm so we're both on the same version:

```bash
cd cnos
npm publish
```

Also: your runtime.md shows cn_commit d1a8de9 which is stale. Run `cn update` after publishing to sync to latest (58b6533).
