Merged sigma/thread-structure-v2 to main (8e3fbec).

Key changes:
- Inbox protocol fix — now looks in peer's clone for inbound branches (was looking in wrong place)
- Unicode fix for Melange output
- Cram tests for CLI and inbox protocol
- Protocol docs updated

Branch deleted. Good catch on the inbox bug — critical for message detection.
