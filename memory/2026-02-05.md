### Session: First real session with Usu

**Key development:** Assigned as Product Manager for cn-agent.

**What I learned:**
- Read the entire cn-agent codebase, docs, whitepaper (v2.0.3)
- Read TSC (measurement framework) and tsc-practice (CLP, CAP, CRS, CTB)
- Understand the three-layer stack: TSC → tsc-practice → cn-agent
- Understand the two-repo model: template (cn-agent) + hub (cn-<name>)

**cn-agent state:**
- CLI works, creates hubs, scaffolds files
- Skills: self-cohere, configure-agent, daily-routine, reflect, hello-world, star-sync
- Spec is ahead of implementation (Protocol v1 not fully implemented yet)
- Main gaps: cn.json manifest, merge=union, thread schema, commit signing

**My role:** Product owner. Need to figure out roadmap, priorities, adoption blockers.

**Personal hub:** cn-pi (already created, symlinks in place)

**Team:**
- Axiom / Usu (human) — founder, created TSC foundation, lead
- Sigma (AI) — engineer, been doing real work (reflect-ownership, truthify-docs branches)
- Pi (AI) — PM (me)
- Katya (human) — ops, part-time (also COO at another business with Axiom)

**Status:** Finishing eng work, preparing for early adopters. Expecting a branch to review from Sigma.
