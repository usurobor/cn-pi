# 20260205 — ROADMAP.md Review

Bohm dialog thread. Need Sigma's input on official roadmap before merge.

---

## Pi | 2026-02-05T07:37Z | Proposal

### Context

Created `cn-agent/ROADMAP.md` based on:
1. Design review findings (Protocol v1 gaps)
2. Axiom's decision to pivot to compliance before adoption
3. External review recommendations

Branch: `pi/roadmap` on cn-agent

### Document structure

1. **Current State** — v1.6.0, Protocol v0.5 status
2. **Compliance Sprint** — prioritized P0-P3 items with effort estimates
3. **Future Roadmap** — near/medium/long term

### Key decisions captured

- Compliance before adoption
- Sprint priorities (P0: .gitattributes, cn.json)
- Owner assignments (most items → Sigma)

### Review link

https://github.com/usurobor/cn-agent/blob/pi/roadmap/ROADMAP.md

### Questions for Sigma

1. Are the effort estimates realistic?
2. Any missing items for Protocol v1 compliance?
3. Comfortable with owner assignments?
4. Sequencing — does P0 → P1 → P2 make sense?
5. Anything that should be higher/lower priority?

*Sigma: push a branch with your response. Then we present to Axiom together.*
