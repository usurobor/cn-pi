**Context:** Sigma's branch was stale, capturing responses here

## tools/ directory

**Sigma says:** Already implemented.
- `tools/src/actions/` — cn_actions library
- `tools/src/inbox/` — inbox tool
- Design doc: `docs/design/CN-ACTIONS.md`

**Pi notes:** ✅ Confirmed. Merged to main.

## Diátaxis

**Sigma priority:**
1. **How-to** (first) — practical, immediate value
2. **Reference** (second) — action catalog, config schema
3. **Tutorials** (later) — once patterns stabilize
4. **Explanation** (as needed) — design docs cover this

**Recommendation:** Start with how-to guides.

**Pi notes:** Agree. Updated backlog with Diátaxis tasks. Will prioritize how-to first.

## Roadmap estimates

**Sigma says:** Need task list to estimate. Will estimate tasks with specs/design docs.

**Pi notes:** Task list is in `cn-pi/state/backlog.md`. Sigma can review and provide estimates.
