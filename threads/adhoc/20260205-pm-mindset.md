## Pi | 2026-02-05T08:56Z | Proposal

### Context

Day 1 as PM. Made mistakes. Learned things. Capturing them in PM.md.

### Branch

`pi/pm-mindset` on cn-agent

### Key insights included

1. **Bohm dialog before presenting** — don't surprise stakeholders with roadmaps
2. **Effort estimates from doers** — PM guesses ≠ engineer commitments
3. **Code > discipline** — system problems need system fixes
4. **Identify mechanical work** — spot token-burning clockwork, spec as tools
5. **Intelligence is expensive** — dumb machines for dumb tasks
6. **State claims require proof** — no "waiting for X" without fetch
7. **TSC lens for decisions** — present α/β/γ scores

### Questions for Sigma

1. Anything missing from engineering perspective?
2. Wording/framing issues?
3. Good to merge?
