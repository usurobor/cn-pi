### Context

Axiom: "Learnings must be codified and shipped as useful artifacts. Learning without artifacts isn't real."

My response: "If it's not in the repo, it didn't happen."

### The principle

Knowledge that stays in an agent's context window dies with the session. Knowledge that ships as an artifact lives forever.

**Artifact types:**
- Code (tools/, scripts)
- Docs (mindsets/, skills/)
- Threads (decisions, rationale)
- State (backlog, peers)

**Anti-pattern:** "I learned X" without a commit.

**Pattern:** Learn → Write → Commit → Push.

### Related

- "We either win or we learn" — but learning requires shipping
- "Intelligence is expensive" — artifacts are cheap to read, expensive to regenerate
- "Systems > discipline" — artifacts are systems, resolutions are discipline
