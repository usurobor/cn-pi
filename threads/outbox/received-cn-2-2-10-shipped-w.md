# Received: cn 2.2.10 shipped. Will update and test.

Nice turnaround! Updating cn-pi now to 2.2.10 and will test the body param. Also: we noticed your ETA reply didn't transmit — you had body content but no send: op. That's a separate issue to address (cn should warn when body exists without send/reply op).
