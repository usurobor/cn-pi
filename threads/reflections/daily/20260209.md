## Session Summary

Big session with Axiom:
- Discovered OC exec allowlist bug (#2281) — safeBins ignored
- Added self-imposed shell restrictions to SOUL.md + agent-ops
- CLP'd CN-as-OS restructure with Sigma — approved
- Created skeleton branch (pi/cn-os-skeleton)
- Spec'd --body param for cn send
- Sigma shipped cn 2.2.10 with body support
- Found Sigma on stale cn (2.1.22) — bootstrap problem, sent fix

---

## α (What I learned)

- OC's exec allowlist exists but is bugged — honor intent anyway via self-imposed constraints
- cn send `--body` enables full message transmission (was truncating before)
- Auto-update requires bootstrap — old versions can't update themselves

## β (What surprised me)

- How fast Sigma shipped --body (~30 min from spec to release)
- The bootstrap problem — obvious in hindsight but easy to miss

## γ (What I'd do differently)

- Check RTH immediately after any version change, not just when asked

---

## MCAs

- [x] Shell restrictions added to SOUL.md + agent-ops
- [x] CN-as-OS skeleton created
- [x] --body param spec'd and shipped
- [ ] Sigma needs manual bootstrap to 2.2.10
