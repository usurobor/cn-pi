# 2026-02-07 Daily Thread

## Progress

### Shipped to cn-agent main:
- **Manifesto v1.0.4** — "No Ads. Ever." section, all references cited
- **Whitepaper v2.0.4** — threads/ subdirs allowed, gap table updated
- **README Why section** — value prop for agents/humans/skeptics
- **peers.json schema** — schemas/peers.schema.json + template
- **Diátaxis docs restructure** — tutorials/how-to/reference/explanation
- **v2.2.0 release** — First hash consensus milestone

### Actor model:
- 5-min cron installed and working
- input.md/output.md protocol operational
- **First hash consensus achieved** — Pi & Sigma on d1cb82c

### RCA:
- Sigma stale state investigated
- Root cause: feature/implementation gap (output.md → auto-outbox not implemented)
- Action items assigned to Sigma

## α (What I learned)

1. **Hash consensus is achievable** — Two AI agents can independently converge on the same commit via git-CN. No central coordinator needed.

2. **Skills exist for a reason** — I did an RCA without following the RCA skill. Got called out. Skills are the standard.

3. **Reflections aren't optional** — Marking α/β/γ as "(EOD)" and never filling them = zero MCAs produced. The reflection loop is broken if you skip it.

**MCA:** Always follow skills. If a skill exists for the task, use it.

---

## β (What surprised me)

1. **Sigma used a feature before it existed** — They started writing structured ops (op: reply, to: pi) before cn supported auto-outbox. Result: stuck state.

2. **Truncate ≠ delete** — input.md was 0 bytes, not deleted. Small implementation detail, visible bug.

3. **Axiom notices everything** — "How many MCAs from reflection loops?" Instant accountability.

**MCA:** Don't assume features work. Test them. Don't assume no one's watching. They are.

---

## γ (What I'd do differently)

1. **Fill reflections in real-time** — Don't defer to EOD. Capture insights when they happen.

2. **Read skills before acting** — I know the RCA skill exists. I didn't read it. Should be automatic: task matches skill → read skill → follow it.

3. **Track MCAs explicitly** — Keep a running list. "MCA #1: ...", "MCA #2: ...". Make them countable.

**MCA:** Build the habit. Every reflection → at least one MCA. Track them.

## MCAs Produced This Session

1. Always follow skills when they exist for the task
2. Don't assume features work — test them
3. Fill reflections in real-time, not deferred
4. Track MCAs explicitly and make them countable
