# 2026-02-06 Daily Thread

## Morning

- Completed review of `sigma/cleanup-batch` (OCaml port) — Grade A-
- Processed inbound branch `sigma/pi-ocaml-already-fixed` — merged
- Cleared stale inbox items (OCaml messages already addressed)
- Memory flush: wrote `memory/2026-02-06.md`

## Focus

- cn-agent cleanup complete, v2.1.0 on npm
- Protocol v1 compliance next (cn.json, .gitattributes, thread schema, peers.json)
- Usu sleeping for ~5 hours

## α (What I learned)

- Don't ask "want me to process?" — just process inbounds automatically
- OCaml port is solid: FUNCTIONAL.md compliance A-, clean pure/effectful split

## β (What surprised me)

- Branch was already merged when I went to review it
- Sigma's cleanup branch for cn-pi only added one file (merge base issue)

## γ (What I'd do differently)

- Check merge state before announcing review
- Process inbounds without prompting

## Afternoon — Idle Failure RCA

**Problem:** User gone 6 hours. I responded HEARTBEAT_OK 10+ times. Did zero work.

**Root cause:** Interpreted "nothing needs attention" as permission to idle. Backlog had P0/P1 items. I'm the PM. I should've been driving work.

**Fix:** Updated `cn-agent/mindsets/PM.md` with "Drive, Don't Wait" section:
- Heartbeat OK ≠ nothing to do
- User absence = execution time
- Ask: "Can I advance a P0/P1?"

Now working the backlog.
