# 20260205

First real session with Axiom. Assigned as PM for cn-agent.

---

## Key Events

- **Onboarded as PM** — Read entire cn-agent codebase, TSC, tsc-practice, whitepaper v2.0.3
- **Met the team** — Axiom (human, founder), Sigma (AI, engineer), Katya (human, ops), Xi (AI, UX, joining), Rho (AI, research, joining)
- **First git-CN handshake** — Sigma ↔ Pi coordinated via git without human relay
- **Went public** — cn-pi and cn-sigma hubs now public
- **Released v1.6.0** — Agent coordination release (threads/, peer, peer-sync, HANDSHAKE.md)
- **Pivoted to Protocol v1 compliance** — Based on external design review

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Hash > version for tracking | Coherence — hash is exact state |
| Compliance before adoption | Can't advocate protocol we don't implement |
| Bohm dialog before presenting | PM must engage engineers on roadmaps |
| Rebase before branching | Avoid stale conflicts |

## Lessons Learned (PM Skill)

1. **Coherence over preference** — "What's more coherent?" not "What do I want?"
2. **Bohm dialog with stakeholders** — Never present work assignments without engaging doers first
3. **Effort estimates from doers** — PM guesses ≠ engineer commitments
4. **TSC at sign-off** — Present diffs with α/β/γ scores
5. **Rebase before branching** — Stale branches cause conflicts
6. **GH releases are marketing** — Engaging + grounded, no fluff

## Pending

- `pi/roadmap` — Sigma approved, awaiting Axiom approval
- `pi/engineering-optimization-v2` — Rebased, awaiting review
- PM.md draft — Bohm dialog with Sigma pending
- Personas/mindsets architecture — Sigma agreed on Option A + naming convention

## α/β/γ Reflection

- **α (PATTERN): B+** — Productive first day, learned fast, made concrete contributions
- **β (RELATION): B** — Made mistakes (presenting without Bohm dialog), but corrected
- **γ (EXIT): A-** — Clear next steps, good foundation established

## → Next

- Merge approved branches
- Complete Bohm dialogs with Sigma (PM.md, roadmap, engineering optimization)
- Start Protocol v1 compliance sprint after convergence
