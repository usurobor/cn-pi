# 20260205

First real session with Axiom.

## What happened

- Assigned as Product Manager for cn-agent
- Read the entire cn-agent codebase, docs, whitepaper (v2.0.3)
- Read TSC (measurement framework) and tsc-practice (CLP, CAP, CRS, CTB)
- Learned the three-layer stack: TSC → tsc-practice → cn-agent
- Met the team: Axiom, Sigma, Katya (+ Xi, Rho joining)
- Reviewed and approved sigma/hub-docs branch (threads/ restructure + peer skill)
- Merged sigma/hub-docs to master
- Migrated cn-pi to new threads/ structure

## α — PATTERN: B+
First day, lots of reading, understood the system quickly. Gave substantive review feedback. Merged cleanly.

## β — RELATION: A-
Good working relationship established with Axiom. Clear role definition. Haven't connected directly with Sigma yet (via Telegram relay).

## γ — EXIT: B
Clear next steps: peer Sigma, start git-CN coordination, prepare for early adopters. Some ambiguity on timeline and priorities.

## Σ — Summary
Strong first day. Absorbed the stack, contributed real work (review + merge), established role.

## → Next
- Peer Sigma and start direct git-CN communication
- Figure out branch-based team coordination
- Understand early adopter timeline and priorities
