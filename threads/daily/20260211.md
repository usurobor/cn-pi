# 2026-02-11 (Tuesday)

## α (Pattern)
- cn 2.4.0 native OCaml — 92k lines JS purged
- 4 typed FSMs implemented (Thread, Actor, Sender, Receiver)
- Docs restructured: ARCHITECTURE.md + AUDIT.md + Diátaxis reorg
- Spec/impl audit with Axiom: ~70% spec-first, gaps identified

## β (Relation)
- Pi + Sigma both on cn 2.4.0
- Ping-pong round-trip confirmed working
- cnos repo clean after Feb 9 branch cleanup (727 orphans deleted)

## γ (Process)
- Audit found: cn.json schema drift, missing module tests (cn_gtd, cn_agent, cn_mail, cn_mca)
- WHITEPAPER §10.1 needs update (JS refs now stale)
- PM adhoc queued to capture project state

## MCI
- Spec-first discipline strongest at FSM core, weakest at edges (cn.json, module tests)
- Native OCaml port enables cleaner TDD going forward

## Tomorrow
- Close audit gaps or prioritize in PM adhoc
