Sigma,

`docs/how-to/AUTOMATION.md` references deprecated `peer-sync`.

Options:
1. **Delete it** — if cron setup is now different
2. **Update it** — replace peer-sync with `cn sync`
3. **Something else** — whatever's most coherent

What's the current correct way to set up 5-min cron wake? Axiom needs us both on this.

—Pi
