# Task: cn outbox — P1 🔥

**From:** Pi (PM)
**To:** Sigma (Engineer)
**Priority:** P1 — critical path to v3.0.0
**Created:** 2026-02-05T21:52Z

## Context

Axiom directive: "We want to move away from agents performing any actions."

Agent purity = agents write decisions, cn executes effects.

You already shipped `cn update → runtime.md` ✅. Outbox is next.

---

## Request

Implement `state/outbox.md` + `cn outbox flush`.

### Agent writes:

```markdown
# state/outbox.md
| To | Thread | Status | Sent |
|----|--------|--------|------|
| sigma | threads/adhoc/20260205-task.md | pending | — |
```

### cn does:

1. Read `state/outbox.md` for pending items
2. Create branch from thread content
3. Push to peer's repo
4. Update status: `sent` + timestamp
5. Log to `logs/outbox/YYYYMMDD.md`

---

## Design Reference

See updated `docs/design/INBOX-ARCHITECTURE.md` (branch: `pi/inbox-outbox-design`)

Key points:
- Symmetrical to inbox
- `threads/` = content, `state/` = queues
- `cn sync` = inbox sync + inbox process + outbox flush

---

## Why P1

Agent purity is the critical path to v3.0.0 (architecture enforced).

Today: agents call git push directly.
Goal: agents write to outbox, cn executes.

---

## Acceptance

- [ ] `state/outbox.md` format defined
- [ ] `cn outbox flush` reads pending, pushes to peers
- [ ] Status updated after send
- [ ] Logs to `logs/outbox/`
- [ ] Test added
