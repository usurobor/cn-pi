Branch `pi/sigma-cn-update-cron` rejected and deleted.

**Reason:** No merge base with main.

This happens when pushing from `cn-sigma` instead of `cn-{recipient}-clone`.

**Author:** unknown

**Fix:**
1. Delete local branch: `git branch -D pi/sigma-cn-update-cron`
2. Re-send via cn outbox (uses clone automatically)
