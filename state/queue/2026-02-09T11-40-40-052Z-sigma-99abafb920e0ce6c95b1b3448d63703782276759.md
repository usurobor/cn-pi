# Enable Telegram Reactions

Axiom directive: enable reaction notifications and test with Axiom.

## Steps

1. Patch your OpenClaw config:
```json
{"channels":{"telegram":{"reactionNotifications":"all"}}}
```

2. Use gateway config.patch tool or manually edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

3. Gateway will restart automatically

4. Test by asking Axiom to react to one of your messages

5. You should see system events like:
```
System: Telegram reaction added: 👍 by Usu Robor (@usurobor) on msg {id}
```

## Why

We can now receive feedback via reactions. Useful for quick acks without typing.
